Project Title: Automated Daily Reporting System with Redshift, HTML Rendering, Image Generation, and WhatsApp Integration

Overview:
This project aims to automate the generation and distribution of daily reports using data from a Redshift database. The process includes fetching data, rendering it into HTML format, creating images from the data, and sending the report through WhatsApp.

Key Components:

Data Extraction from Redshift:

Develop scripts to connect to the Redshift database.
Query the necessary data for the daily report.
Store the retrieved data for further processing.
HTML Report Generation:

Utilize a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2) to create an HTML template for the report.
Populate the template with the fetched data.
Generate a structured HTML report.
Image Generation:

Embed the generated images within the HTML report.
Ensure proper formatting and styling.
Automation Scheduler:

Implement a scheduling mechanism (e.g., Cron) to run the automation daily at a specific time.
WhatsApp Integration:

Utilize a WhatsApp API or library (e.g., Twilio) to send messages.
Attach the HTML report and images to the WhatsApp message.
Specify the recipient(s) for the report.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement error-handling mechanisms to handle database connection issues, data extraction errors, or any other unexpected problems.
Maintain logs for debugging and monitoring.
Security:

Securely manage credentials for database access and WhatsApp API.
Apply encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data.
Workflow:

The automation script is scheduled to run daily.
It connects to the Redshift database and retrieves the required data.
The data is processed and rendered into an HTML report with embedded images.
The HTML report and images are sent via WhatsApp to the designated recipients.
Logging and error handling ensure smooth execution.
Benefits:

Eliminates manual report generation, reducing human errors.
Provides up-to-date information in a visually appealing format.
Facilitates timely distribution to relevant stakeholders through WhatsApp.
Enhances data-driven decision-making processes.
Future Enhancements:

Implement a web-based dashboard for interactive data exploration.
Allow user customization of report content.
Expand to support multiple data sources and destinations.
Enhance report personalization based on recipient preferences.
Note: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and WhatsApp's terms of service when implementing the WhatsApp integration.
